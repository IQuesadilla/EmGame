## Editing and Building
DO NOT overwrite the existing TCL file via Vivado. It will break it. Instead, edit it by hand.
The current TCL is edited with the guidance of the following link: https://www.fpgadeveloper.com/2014/08/version-control-for-vivado-projects.html/. To build, just use "Tools -> Run Tcl Script..." from within Vivado (alternatively, source build.tcl from the Tcl Console).
